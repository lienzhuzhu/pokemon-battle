## Design

* Made using JavaScript
* AJAX calls made using XMLHttpRequest 
* Debugged race issue problems including
  * Manipulating content that hasn't been loaded yet
  * Mistiming when trying to populate object member attributes with content from API 
  * Fixed these issues by adding buttons as hacks to ensure data has been retrieved completely from API

## Future

Would like to randomize pokemon options on start page and randomize move options. 
For game mechanics, implementing a system that only allows moves to be made a certain number of times would enhance gameplay.
